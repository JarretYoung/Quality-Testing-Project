## Software Quality Testing on an Event Manager

This project is a display of software quality testing measures and practices. The project was built using a Test-Driven Development approach to facilitate the writing of clear and simple code of acceptable quality. This approach also ensures that code written is covered by testcases and this helps reduce the time taken for debugging. 

A small team was assigned to develop a event manager that enables functionalities such as creation and deletion of google events while utiliing the google calendar API. There are many validity checks to ensure that the data inputted is of a valid type and syntax and these constrains are tested against to ensure correctness.
